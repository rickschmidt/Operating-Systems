						Decision to use Mach
					</h1>
					<p>
						Next wanted to use a kernel that was well represented in business and academia. The kernel needed to support multi tasking and multiple users and also be network compatible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pure UNIX supported all of these ideals but their position was that mach provided better performance and supported future enhancements. Since there was a unix compatible layer in mach the choice was clear.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the years UNIX grew and grew supporting more features that caused a performance hit and mach was billed as a microkernel.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mach kernel itself is small due to the fact that anything that anything that could be put in user space was. The kernel itself supported only the creation of user tasks and communication between them using ports

					<h1 id="memory">
						Memory
					</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Next used mapped memory and virtual memory
						</li>
						<li>Each task had 4GBs of mapped virtual memory to operate in
						</li>
						<li>Next used what it called <em>demand paging</em>
							<ul>
								<li>Only the page that references the address of the active process needs to be in physical memory.
								</li>
								<li>If not the kernel would if necessary remove the oldest referenced page from memory and move then move the new one in
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The developer documentation claims that this process allows <em>extremely large</em> applications to run on next hardware.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Memory was conserved in mach thorough its implementation of <code>fork()</code>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Instead of copying all of a parents address space to the child memory was only copied when a child requested
						</li>

						Mutual Exclusion

					<ul>
						<li>

<code>
mutex_lock(m);
count += 1;
mutex_unlock(m);

								There was also a framework called Mach Kit which provided a form of mutual exclusion

						<li>Each thread is assigned a priority between 0-31
						</li>
						<li>Blocking or long running threads have their priority decreased
						</li>
						<li>Threads have three priorities (base, current, max)

						<li>Along with the time sharing policy next had an incomplete implementation for interactive scheduling and a non recommended fixed scheduling policy.

						<li>WebObjects was adopted by several large companies in the mid 90s but adoption quickly slowed after Apple's acquistion of NeXT
						</li>
						<li>Originally a license was $50K
						</li>
						<li>Apple included them in the Dev Tools for free in 2005 and later dropped support.

						<li>In 1996 Apple was losing big time to Windows. OS 9 supported cooperative multitasking and was really only or a single user.
